            Due to the Covid-19 lockdown, many students in CS, EECS, CSE, and other tech majors are without
            opportunities to further their CS journeys this summer as they normally would. In response to this need,
            CodeDay and Mentors in Tech are offering a virtual internship experience lead by industry volunteers
            for current CS majors.

            Each industry volunteer will lead a group of 3 students, helping them build a project based on the
            volunteerâ€™s experience and expertise, in 6 weeks. Volunteers will lead the students through design,
            implementation, test, completion, and presentation of the project.

            As an industry expert, the volunteer will guide the student team through the project facing real world
            challenges faced by real engineers working on real projects.

            Through this virtual internship experience, the student participants will have had their first sustained
            hands on experience of working with an industry professional. Students will learn from the industry
            volunteer: project management, team work, communications, modern technical skills, and standard industry
            practices.
